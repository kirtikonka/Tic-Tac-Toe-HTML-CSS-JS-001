#INDEX.HTML EXPLAINATION
* **HTML Structure:**
    * The code defines the basic structure of the webpage using HTML tags.
    * It includes a `<head>` section with meta information and a `<title>` for the game ("Tic Tac Toe").
    * The `<body>` section contains the main content of the page.
    * A `<nav>` element likely holds a navigation bar (currently with just the game title).
    * A `div` with class `gameContainer` holds the main game elements:
        * A `div` with class `container` represents the Tic Tac Toe board itself. It contains nine inner `div` elements with classes representing their positions and borders (e.g., `bt-0 bl-0` for top and left borders). Each inner `div` has a `span` with class `boxtext` which likely holds the content displayed in each box (X, O, or empty).
        * A `div` with class `gameInfo` displays game information:
            * An `<h1>` element displays the game title ("Tic Tac Toe").
            * A section shows whose turn it is ("Turn for X") and potentially holds a "Reset" button.
            * An `imgBox` likely displays a win image (based on the `src` attribute) when the game is won.
* **External Resources:**
    * The code references a stylesheet (`style.css`) likely containing styles for the game's visual appearance (colors, fonts, etc.).
    * It also references a script (`script.js`) which is probably where the game logic (handling clicks, tracking game state, etc.) is implemented using JavaScript.

#SCRIPT.JS EXPLAINATION
This code implements the logic for a Tic Tac Toe game webpage, likely corresponding to the previously explained HTML structure. Here's a breakdown:

**Global Variables:**

* `turn`: This variable keeps track of whose turn it is ("X" or "O").
* `isgameover`: This boolean flag indicates if the game is over (True) or not (False).

**Functions:**

* `changeTurn()`: This function simply switches the turn between "X" and "O".

* `checkWin()`: This function checks for a winning condition.
    * It retrieves all elements with class `boxtext` which represent the content displayed in each box on the board.
    * It defines an array `wins` containing lists of indexes representing winning positions (rows, columns, diagonals).
    * It iterates through each winning combination in `wins`.
    * For each combination (represented by a list of indexes `[e[0], e[1], e[2]]`), it checks if the inner text of corresponding `boxtext` elements match (all are the same symbol and not empty).
    * If a winning condition is met, it displays the winner message, sets the `isgameover` flag, and potentially modifies the win image size (based on commented-out code).

**Event Listeners:**
* The code retrieves all elements with class `box` (likely representing the individual squares on the board).
* It iterates through each `box` element and adds a click event listener.
    * When a box is clicked, the code checks if the corresponding `boxtext` element is empty.
    * If empty, it sets the `boxtext` to the current player's symbol (`turn`), switches the turn using `changeTurn()`, checks for a win using `checkWin()`, and updates the turn information displayed on the page (unless the game is already over).

* The code also adds a click event listener to the reset button (`reset`).
    * When clicked, it resets the game by:
        * Clearing the inner text of all `boxtext` elements (emptying the board).
        * Resetting the `turn` to "X".
        * Setting `isgameover` to False.
        * Resetting the width of the winning line element (likely a visual indicator for the winning combination - commented out).
        * Updating the turn information displayed on the page.

#STYLE.CSS EXPLAINATION
* **General Styles:**
  * It resets margins and paddings for all elements.
  * It imports the Roboto font family from Google Fonts.

* **Navigation Bar:**
  * It styles the navigation bar with a black background, white text, and Roboto font.
  * It sets the height, font size, and flexbox properties for alignment.

* **Game Container:**
  * It centers the game container horizontally using flexbox.
  * It adds a margin at the top.

* **Board Container:**
  * It defines the board layout using a CSS grid with three rows and three columns, each sized based on the viewport width (10vw).
  * It sets the font family to Roboto.

* **Individual Boxes:**
  * It styles each box with a black border, font size based on viewport width (8vw), pointer cursor, and centered text.
  * It adds a hover effect with a light blue background color.

* **Game Information:**
  * It styles the game information section with padding and Roboto font.
  * It sets a larger font size for the game title ("Tic Tac Toe").

* **Win Image:**
  * It hides the win image initially by setting its width to 0.
  * It defines a smooth transition for the width when displayed.

* **Reset Button:**
  * It styles the reset button with a background color, border radius, and Roboto font.
  * It sets font size, weight, and cursor style.

* **Responsive Design:**
  * The code includes a media query for screens less than 950px wide.
    * It wraps the game container content if the screen is narrow.
    * It adjusts the margins and font size for the game information section.
    * It increases the size of the grid cells to maintain better visibility on smaller screens.

* **Commented-out Styles:**
  * The code includes commented-out styles for a winning line element. It seems this feature might not be currently implemented.
